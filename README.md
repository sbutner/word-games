#Liar's Dice
Liar's dice is a game where players roll a hand of 5 dice and place wagers about the quantity and value of dice. Players can call another player's wager, forcing everyone to reveal their dice and determine whether the wager was valid or not. If the wager was valid, the player who called loses a die, otherwise the player who wagered loses a die. The players then roll a new hand of dice. The game ends when only one player can still roll.
